    <p class="justify">
    My education background is a BBA (Bachelors Biz Mgmt) in MIS (Mgmt info systems) from The University of Georgia. I first came to China in 2011 to study abroad in Dalian and then stayed to launch a hardware startup through Chinaccelerator batch 2 that made it to TechCrunch Disrupt's Startup Battlefield in Beijing. I'm currently a founder and Product Manager of a US-based fundraising platform (Zurly.com) and also a LED/Solar consumer product manufacturer (GoVolt.com).  Right now I'm trying to choose between focusing more on hardware or software. I want to delve deeper into either software development or hardware development and Le Wagon should help me quickly figure out if software dev is something I should pursue. After the program I'm pretty wide open. We'll have to see where I'm at in two months :)
